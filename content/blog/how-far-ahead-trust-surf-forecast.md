You're trying to plan a surf trip for next weekend. The forecast says 4-6ft, offshore winds, looking epic. You book the rental, take Friday off, tell your friends.

Then the day comes and it's 2ft onshore slop.

We've all been there. But here's the thing: it's not really the forecast's fault. You just trusted it too far out.

## The Honest Truth About Forecast Windows

Wave forecasts degrade fast. Like, really fast. Here's roughly what you can expect:

**0-24 hours:** Pretty reliable. Models have current data to work with — actual buoy readings, satellite imagery, real-time wind observations. If the forecast says it's firing tomorrow morning, it probably is.

**2-3 days:** Decent. The general pattern is usually right. If it says a swell is coming, a swell is probably coming. But the size might be off by 1-2ft and the timing could shift by half a day.

**4-5 days:** Rough guidance only. Good for knowing "something might happen this weekend" but not for booking hotels. Expect significant changes.

**6-7 days:** Coin flip territory. The forecast will probably change multiple times before that day arrives. Use it for vague planning, nothing more.

**8+ days:** Entertainment, not information. Models are basically guessing. Whatever you see will almost certainly be different by the time you get there.

## Why Forecasts Fall Apart

Wave forecasts depend on weather forecasts. And weather forecasts have the same problem — they're predicting a chaotic system.

Small errors compound. A storm that's predicted to track one direction might wobble slightly. That wobble changes the wind fetch. The changed fetch produces a different swell. By day 5, that tiny wobble has turned your "head-high and clean" into "waist-high and onshore."

The technical term is "sensitive dependence on initial conditions." The practical term is "weather is hard."

### East Coast Is Worse

If you surf the East Coast, add an extra dose of uncertainty.

West Coast surfers get long-period swells from distant storms in the Pacific. Those swells are already in the water, traveling toward shore. You can see them coming for days.

East Coast? We get short-period wind swell that generates quickly from nearby systems. A nor'easter can pop up, generate surf, and disappear faster than models can track. Hurricane swells are better (longer period, more predictable), but we only get a handful of those per year.

Our swells are born and die in the same window that West Coast surfers use for fine-tuning.

## What Different Models Get Right

Here's something most forecast apps won't tell you: different models have different strengths at different time ranges.

**WaveWatch III (NOAA):** Updates frequently, reacts fast to changing conditions. Better for short-term, especially locally-generated wind swell. Can miss longer-term trends.

**ECMWF (European):** Generally considered the gold standard for 3-7 day forecasts. Better at tracking large-scale weather systems. This is the model that nailed Hurricane Sandy's track when American models had it going out to sea.

**Open-Meteo / GFS-based:** Good baseline, updates often. Useful for cross-referencing but not always the most accurate standalone.

No single model wins every time. That's why at [Howzit](https://hwztsurf.com) we pull from all three and show you when they agree vs. disagree. High agreement at 3 days out? More confident. Models all over the place? Take it with a grain of salt.

## How to Actually Plan a Surf Trip

Given all this, here's how to not get burned:

**For tomorrow:** Trust the forecast. Check it the night before and again in the morning. If it looks good, go.

**For this weekend (3-4 days):** Look at the trend, not the specific numbers. Is a swell coming? Probably yes or no. But don't fixate on "4-6ft Saturday morning" — that could easily become "3-4ft Saturday afternoon" or "5-7ft Sunday."

**For next weekend (7+ days):** Check if there's *any* swell in the forecast. If yes, keep it on your radar. If no, don't write it off completely — things change. But don't book non-refundable anything based on a 10-day forecast.

**For a trip you already booked:** Start watching the forecast 5 days out. Expect it to change. Have backup spots in mind. Accept that you might get skunked — that's surfing.

## The Re-Check Schedule

If you're planning around a swell, here's when to check:

- **7 days out:** First look. Is there a system forming? Note it, don't commit.
- **5 days out:** Getting real. Swell still showing? Start making loose plans.
- **3 days out:** Decision time for anything requiring commitment (time off, travel). Forecast is reasonably trustworthy now.
- **1 day out:** Final check. Nail down timing — early morning or afternoon session?
- **Morning of:** Confirm. Check buoys for actual swell arrival. Look at wind.

Each check, expect the numbers to shift. That's normal. What you're looking for is whether the overall pattern holds — swell coming, wind manageable, your spot in the window.

## Buoys Don't Lie

Here's your secret weapon: NOAA buoy data.

Buoys measure what's actually in the water right now. No forecasting, no models, just sensors bobbing in the ocean telling you wave height and period.

The morning of a session, check the nearest offshore buoy. If it's showing the swell the forecast predicted, you're good. If the buoy is flat and the forecast says 4ft, something went wrong with the prediction.

Buoys are also useful for timing. You can watch a swell build on the buoy hours before it hits the beach. Once you see it on the buoy, you know it's real and roughly when it'll arrive.

We show buoy data on [Howzit](https://hwztsurf.com) for this reason. It's the ground truth that cuts through model uncertainty.

## The Confidence Indicator

This is why we built confidence ratings into Howzit.

When you see "High Confidence" on a forecast, it means the three models we pull from are agreeing. They might all be wrong together, but that's rare. Agreement usually means reliability.

When you see "Low Confidence," the models are fighting. One says 4ft, another says 2ft, the third says something else. That's your signal to stay flexible.

Most apps hide this from you. They pick one model, show you a single number, and let you think it's certain. It's not. Uncertainty is part of forecasting — hiding it doesn't make it go away.

## What This Means For You

Stop planning your life around 7-day forecasts. They're not built for that.

Use long-range forecasts to get excited, to start thinking about which spots might work, to put a trip on your radar. But don't commit money or PTO until you're inside 3-4 days.

And when you do commit, keep checking. The forecast that convinced you to go might look different by the time you get there. That's not failure — that's just how the ocean works.

The surfers who score the most aren't the ones with the best forecasts. They're the ones who stay flexible, check often, and know when to trust the numbers vs. when to go look for themselves.
