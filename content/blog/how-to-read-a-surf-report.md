You check the app. It says 3ft at 8 seconds, wind SW at 12mph. Cool. But is that... good? Should you go? What does any of it actually mean?

I remember staring at surf reports for months before any of it clicked. Nobody explains this stuff. You're just supposed to know somehow.

So here's the guide I wish someone gave me.

## The Three Numbers That Matter

Every surf report boils down to three things: wave height, wave period, and wind. That's it. Everything else is extra.

### Wave Height

This one seems obvious but it's tricky.

When a report says "3ft," that's the *face height* of the wave — what you'd actually ride. Some apps use "significant wave height" which is a scientific measurement that often reads smaller than what you'll see at the beach.

**Quick guide:**

- **1-2ft** — Beginner friendly. Mellow. Good for learning.
- **3-4ft** — Fun for most surfers. Solid day.
- **5-6ft** — Getting serious. Intermediate+.
- **8ft+** — Know what you're doing or stay on the beach.

Here's the thing though — 3ft at a steep beach break hits different than 3ft at a mellow point break. Size isn't everything.

### Wave Period

This is the secret sauce that beginners ignore and experienced surfers obsess over.

Period is the time between waves, measured in seconds. It tells you how much *energy* is in the swell.

**What the numbers mean:**

- **5-7 seconds** — Short period. Weak, choppy, wind-generated waves. The kind that crumble and close out.
- **8-10 seconds** — Medium period. Decent energy. Surfable.
- **11-14 seconds** — Long period. Powerful, organized waves. Ground swell. The good stuff.
- **15+ seconds** — Very long period. Usually big, powerful swells from distant storms.

Here's why it matters: a 3ft wave at 14 seconds will be way more powerful and fun than a 4ft wave at 6 seconds. The 4ft wave will be junky wind chop. The 3ft wave will have push.

**Rule of thumb:** Anything under 8 seconds is usually not worth the drive. Anything over 12 seconds is worth rearranging your schedule.

### Wind Speed and Direction

Wind can make or break a session.

**Offshore wind** — Blows from land toward ocean. Holds up the wave face, creates clean conditions. This is what you want.

**Onshore wind** — Blows from ocean toward land. Mushes everything out. Bumpy, crumbly, frustrating.

**Cross-shore wind** — Blows parallel to the beach. Not ideal but surfable.

**Speed matters too:**

- **0-5mph** — Glassy. Perfect conditions.
- **5-10mph** — Light texture. Still good.
- **10-15mph** — Noticeable chop if onshore.
- **15mph+** — Probably blown out unless it's offshore.

Early mornings are usually best because wind is lightest before the land heats up.

## Swell Direction: The Part Everyone Forgets

Swell direction tells you where the waves are coming from. This matters because beaches face different directions.

If you're at an east-facing beach and the swell is coming from the south, you might be in a "swell shadow" — the waves won't wrap into your spot.

**East Coast basics:**

- **E/ESE swells** — Hit most beaches directly. Usually good.
- **NE swells** — Nor'easter energy. Can be powerful but often comes with bad wind.
- **SE/S swells** — Hurricane swells. When these hit, pay attention.

Each beach has a "swell window" — the directions it picks up best. Local knowledge helps here, or you find a forecast that accounts for it (shameless plug: we do this at [Howzit](https://hwztsurf.com/spots)).

## Tides: The Timing Factor

Tides affect wave shape. Some spots work better at high tide, others at low.

**General patterns:**

- **Low tide** — Waves break in shallower water. Often steeper, hollower, faster. Can close out on beach breaks.
- **High tide** — Waves break in deeper water. Often mushier, slower. More forgiving.
- **Mid tide** — Usually the safe bet. Most spots work.
- **Moving tides** — Some spots are best on incoming (rising) or outgoing (dropping) tide.

Check when high and low tides are, then think about when the tide will be *moving* through the mid-range. That's often prime time.

## Putting It All Together

Let's say you see this forecast:

> **4ft at 11 seconds, SSE swell, wind W at 8mph, mid tide**

Breaking it down:

- 4ft — Solid size, fun for most
- 11 seconds — Good period, real energy behind it
- SSE swell — Coming from the south-southeast, check if your beach picks that up
- Wind W at 8mph — Westerly is offshore for east-facing beaches, light speed = clean
- Mid tide — Usually works

**Verdict:** Go. This is a good day.

Now compare to:

> **5ft at 6 seconds, E swell, wind E at 18mph, low tide**

Breaking it down:

- 5ft — Sounds big but...
- 6 seconds — Short period, junky wind swell
- E swell — Direct, but with that wind...
- Wind E at 18mph — Strong onshore. Blown out.
- Low tide — Probably closing out

**Verdict:** Skip it. Looks bigger on paper but conditions are trash.

## The Beginner Cheat Sheet

**Go surfing when:**

- Period is 8+ seconds
- Wind is under 10mph (or offshore)
- Tide is mid or matches your spot

**Stay home when:**

- Period is under 7 seconds
- Wind is onshore 15mph+
- Report says "choppy" or "blown out"

**Best conditions for learning:**

- 2-3ft
- 10+ second period (mellow power)
- Light wind or offshore
- Mid to high tide

## One More Thing

Forecasts are predictions, not guarantees. Models disagree with each other constantly — sometimes by 2-3ft for the same spot.

That's actually why we built [Howzit](https://hwztsurf.com). We pull from three different forecast models and show you when they agree (high confidence) vs. when they're all over the place (low confidence). Check spots like [Virginia Beach](/spots/virginia-beach) or [Cocoa Beach](/spots/cocoa-beach-pier) to see it in action.

Check the report, but also check the cams. And when in doubt, just go look. Sometimes the best sessions happen when the forecast looks meh.
