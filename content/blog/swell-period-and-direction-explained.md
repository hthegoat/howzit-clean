You check the surf report. It says 4ft. Nice, you think. Time to go.

Then you show up to knee-high mush.

What happened? Probably the two numbers you skipped over: swell period and swell direction. They're the difference between a firing session and a wasted drive.

## Swell Period: The Most Important Number You're Ignoring

Swell period is the time between wave crests, measured in seconds. It sounds boring. It's not.

Think of it this way: wave height tells you how tall the waves are. Period tells you how much *power* is behind them.

A 4ft wave at 6 seconds? That's weak, locally-generated wind chop. Probably junky and disorganized.

A 3ft wave at 14 seconds? That's a ground swell that traveled hundreds of miles. Clean, powerful, organized lines. The kind of wave that makes you call in sick to work.

### Why Period = Power

Longer period swells form from sustained wind over vast ocean distances. That energy travels deep underwater — we're talking 400+ feet down for a 15-second swell.

When that deep energy hits shallow water near shore, it releases everything. The wave jacks up, throws, and has real push. Short period wind slop travels near the surface and crumbles when it hits the beach.

**The cheat sheet:**

- **Under 7 seconds** — Wind slop. Choppy, weak, closes out. Usually not worth it.
- **8-10 seconds** — Surfable. Medium energy. Good for beginners on smaller days.
- **11-13 seconds** — Now we're talking. Organized waves with push. Worth rearranging your schedule.
- **14+ seconds** — Ground swell. Serious power. Drop everything.

The East Coast rarely sees long period swells — we're talking maybe a handful of times per year from hurricane swells or large nor'easters. When you see 12+ seconds, pay attention. That's the good stuff.

### Period and Beach Breaks

Here's something most forecasts don't mention: longer periods hit shallower sandbars harder.

A 4ft swell at 14 seconds might actually break bigger than 5ft at 8 seconds. The long-period energy is concentrated, and beach breaks amplify it.

Reef and point breaks handle long periods better — they're designed for that energy. Beach breaks can get heavy and closeout-y when big ground swells hit. Something to keep in mind on those rare days the East Coast gets proper swell.

## Swell Direction: Where It's Coming From Matters

Swell direction is exactly what it sounds like: the compass bearing the swell is traveling from. But here's why it matters.

Every beach faces a certain direction. A beach that faces east works great for swells coming from the east. But what if the swell is coming from the south?

That wave has to bend — or "refract" — to hit your beach. Some energy gets lost. Sometimes a lot of energy. This is called being in a "swell shadow."

### East Coast Swell Windows

Most East Coast beaches face somewhere between northeast and southeast. Here's what different swell directions mean:

**E / ESE Swells (90° - 110°)**

The sweet spot for most beaches. Direct hit, minimal refraction, maximum energy. These come from offshore storms and can produce clean, powerful surf.

**NE Swells (45° - 60°)**

Nor'easter territory. Often comes with onshore wind, which can mess up the surface. But when the wind swings offshore after the storm passes, you get that classic post-nor'easter magic.

**SE / S Swells (135° - 180°)**

Hurricane and tropical storm swells. These can light up spots that are usually flat. South-facing beaches that normally miss swell suddenly turn on. Worth tracking if you know your local swell windows.

**N Swells (350° - 30°)**

Rare on the East Coast. Usually means something interesting is happening weather-wise. Some spots in the Outer Banks and New England can pick these up.

### Swell Windows Are Local

This is the thing forecasts often miss: every beach has a unique swell window based on how it's oriented and what's blocking it.

A beach tucked behind a headland might miss a direct E swell but light up on a SE swell that wraps around. A south-facing stretch might be flat when north-facing beaches are firing.

This is why checking multiple spots matters. A forecast that says "3-4ft" for your region might mean head-high at one beach and ankle-high at another five miles away.

## Putting It Together: The Real Forecast

Let's look at two hypothetical forecasts for the same day:

**Forecast A:** 4ft at 7 seconds, swell from 90° (E)

**Forecast B:** 3ft at 12 seconds, swell from 145° (SE)

Which is better? Depends on your beach.

If your beach faces east, Forecast A might seem appealing — direct swell. But that 7-second period means weak, choppy waves. Probably not worth it.

Forecast B has less height but that 12-second period means real power. If your beach can pick up SE swell, those 3ft waves might actually feel bigger and way more fun than the "4ft" wind slop.

**The lesson:** height is the last thing to look at. Period first, then direction, then height.

## Why This Matters for Your Surf Report

Most surf apps give you a single wave height number. Maybe a simple rating. They don't show you the period, or they bury it. They don't explain swell direction relative to your beach.

That's why you drive an hour for "4ft good" and find 2ft blown-out mush.

At [Howzit](https://hwztsurf.com), we show you all of it. Wave height, swell period, swell direction for each spot. Our spot ratings factor in how well each beach picks up the current swell direction — not just raw height.

You can see the swell charts and make your own call. Because once you understand period and direction, you'll never trust a simple "3-4ft" forecast again.

## Quick Reference: Before You Go

**Check the period first.** Under 8 seconds? Probably skip it. Over 11? Worth the drive.

**Check the direction.** Does your beach face that way? Is there anything blocking the swell from reaching your break?

**Then check height.** Now you have context. 3ft at 13 seconds from the right direction beats 5ft at 6 seconds every time.

**Factor in wind.** Even perfect swell gets ruined by strong onshore wind. Period and direction get you to the beach — wind decides if it's actually good.

Once you start thinking this way, you'll score way more sessions and waste way fewer mornings staring at disappointing waves.
